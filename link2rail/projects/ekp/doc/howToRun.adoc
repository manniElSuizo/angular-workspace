# How To Run

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Production

The repository comes with a Dockerfile, that configures an nginx to serve the app. While the nginx config was meant for production purposes, you should check if it meets your needs. You can build and test the container locally by running.

`docker build -t ri-angular . && docker run -p 8080:4200 ri-angular`

The included .gitlab-ci.yml deploys this docker image into an OpenShift namespace.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to start the development server and execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://cypress.io)
