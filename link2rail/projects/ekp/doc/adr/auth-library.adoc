# Architecture Decision Record: OIDC Library

Date: 2019-07-18

## State

Prove of Concept

## Kontext

We need to implement the authentication/authorization based on
OpendID Connect (OIDC) protocol, which is an extension on oauth2 standard.

There are multiple options

* selfmade
* Javascript library: https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js
* Alternative libraries:;
** https://github.com/andreassolberg/jso
** https://github.com/zalando-stups/oauth2-client-js
** https://github.com/salte-auth/salte-auth
** https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/auth0js/v9
** http://www.passportjs.org/docs/oauth/

The solution must be compatible with [DB WebSSO](https://db-planet.deutschebahn.com/workspaces/secure-access-services/apps/wiki/sso/list/view/ae52fb7b-9109-4948-bd18-022334af7dd2)

## Decision

The second option: `oidb-client.js` was chosen, because:

* it is one of two certified js client libs by openid.net
see -> https://openid.net/developers/certified/

* it is already used in business hub
https://git.tech.rz.db.de/dbs-businesshub/bh-infra/product-dashboard/merge_requests/84/diffs

The first option to implement it by myself, was not taken because:

* it should support "authorization code flow" for public client (= without server),
which is more complex in browser than for confidential client (= with server)
* so that potential risk to introduce security flaws is high

Other alternatives were dropped because of missing openid.net certification.
