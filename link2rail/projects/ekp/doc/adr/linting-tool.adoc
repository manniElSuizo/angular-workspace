# Architecture Decision Record: Linting Tool

Date: 2021-04-29

## State

Decided

## Kontext

The Angular Team removed the support for TSLint static code analyzing using codelyzer with Angular 10.
TSLint isn't further developed as the common Tools used for JavaScript linting ESLint has grown, evolved and supports TypeScript as well.

## Decision

Since ESLint is the most used linting tool (reference: link:https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/other-tools/#utilities[stateofjs.com 2020 survey]), and the Angular team strongly recommends using ESLint but doesn't provide an out-of-the-box migration, a manuel migration from TSLint to ESlint has been done.
