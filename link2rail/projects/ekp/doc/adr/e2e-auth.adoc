# Architecture Decision Record: e2e test authentication implementation

Date: 2021-05-25

## State

Decided

Extends:

- link:auth-library.adoc[OIDC Library]
- link:e2e-lib.adoc[e2e Testing Library]

## Kontext

Some features of the application are protected and only accessible once a user has been logged in via OIDC.
The common way at DB is to use the DB Web SSO OIDC provider to process the authentication (see: link:../howToAuth.adoc["How To Auth"]).

As Cypress is our default e2e testing library, it should be possible to test the whole authentication process.
However, Cypress has currently some limitations, that only allows tests within a single domain.
The state of this limitation can be monitored at Github:
https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/944#issuecomment-846970915

As our app will redirect to another domain for authentication after clicking on the "Login"-Button, and redirects after successful login, we needed a way to tell cypress, wether an authentication process was successful or not.

## Decision

To be able to handle the temporarily switch of the domains for authentication, we decided to use a cypress plugin that will make use of the library link:https://github.com/microsoft/playwright[Playwright] to open another chrome browser in CI mode before starting the tests.
With this browser the authentication is processed.
Details can be found in the implementation in link:cypress/plugins/auth.js[cypress/plugins/auth.js].
The whole authentication in managed within this second browser session.
At the end, all cookies, sessions and localStorage data are passed through the plugin into the first browser session (Cypress).
Now, all this data is used by cypress and in fact the user is authenticated successfully.
